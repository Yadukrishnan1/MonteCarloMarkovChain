# MCMC Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains files related to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis project. The project aims to use MCMC methods to estimate the parameters of a Bayesian model and make inferences about the relationships between variables.

## Files
- `mcmc.py`: Python script for defining the Bayesian model, performing MCMC sampling, and analyzing the posterior distributions.
- `bayesian_regression_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset for Bayesian linear regression analysis.

## Usage
The `mcmc.py` script can be used to perform MCMC sampling and analyze the posterior distributions of the Bayesian model. The `bayesian_regression_data.csv` file contains the synthetic dataset used in the analysis.

## Installation
To run the `mcmc.py` script, you will need Python 3.8 and the following libraries: PyMC3, NumPy, Pandas, and ArviZ. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
